- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alp361

Iâ€™m interested in web development, web pentesting, cyber security, and artificial intelligence.Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript. I'm practising my HTML5 and CSS3 skills.
My priority is being a front-end developer for now. I want to learn back-end development after I have enough experience in front-end development.
